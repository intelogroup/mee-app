Render CLI v2.5.0

Welcome! Use the Render CLI to manage your services, datastores, and
environments directly from the command line. Trigger deploys, view logs,
start psql/SSH sessions, and more.

The CLI's default interactive mode provides intuitive, menu-based navigation.

To use in non-interactive mode (such as in a script), set each command's --output
option to either json or yaml for structured responses.
